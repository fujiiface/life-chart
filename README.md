# Your Life In ## Years

## What is this?
This is a chart based on Tim Urban's chart from https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html.  Once you set your birthday, it will automatically fill the squares up for you.

## Directions
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `app.js`
3. Modify `let person = new Person('<YOUR BIRTHDAY>').setYears(90).save();` by doing the following
   1. Replace `<YOUR BIRTHDAY>` with your birthdate (make sure you remove the <>)
   2. Adjust the number of years by changing `.setYears(90)` to what you want
4. Open index.html
5. Freak out

Note: The header text is currently hard-coded. If you want it to match the number of years set on the `Person` object, you will have to do it manually in the `index.html` file.
